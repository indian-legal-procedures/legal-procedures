### How to Get a Demand Draft Issued

-   Visit the bank where you have your account.
-   Draw cash in the name of "self"
-   Ask the bank teller to give you the form needed to be filled for making the demand draft
-   Fill in the details and submit the form along with the cheque.
-   The teller will scrutinize all the details and once he is satisfied, he will ask you to pay a small charge for making the DD
-   He will then stamp the DD and hand it over to you.

You can also get the DD made through cash, in case you do not have an account in the bank. The same can also be done online.
