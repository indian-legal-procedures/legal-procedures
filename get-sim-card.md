## Must Know These Facts About Buying a SIM Card in India

1. **Types of SIM cards:** There are two types of Indian SIM cards available namely; postpaid and prepaid or pay as you go SIM. A postpaid SIM Card is the one where you are billed after having used the services like calling, data, texting. Postpaid plans cost more than prepaid plans generally whereas a prepaid sim card in india for foreigners or a pay as you go sim india is where you pay before hand to avail services like calling, data, texting. The plans on this one are comparatively cheaper.

2. Validity of a tourist SIM card is for max 90 days. After that it will automatically get disabled. If you are here for longer than 90 days you will have to rely on an Indian resident to get you a card. Or you will have to get a new SIM card for a foreigner with a new number.

3. In most of the parts of the world, mobile phones are locked to their telecom carriers and only they (your telecom carrier) can unlock the phones for you. You will not be able to insert another sim or use it with another carrier unless unlocked.

4. To obtain an international/ travel SIM card in India, you need to present the following documents in original and photocopies:
	- Passport
	- Photographs
	- Indian Visa
	- Local Address Documents
	- Home Address Proof and some more depending on your SIM card provider’s and seller’s requirement.

 5. Within 15 hours of your details being successfully verified, your SIM card to use in India should be active. Post that you can go back to the shop and top up or recharge your phone.

6. You will have to make sure that you are in the same area as you bought the roaming SIM card for the activation to go through. For instance, if you bought the local SIM card in Delhi, you cannot complete the activation if you have travelled outside of Delhi. It has to be done within the same area it was issued.

7. Indian government tried a scheme with free tourist BSNL SIM cards and international SIM cards being sold at airports. The free sim card in india for foreigners that BSNL used to provide, has now been discontinued. There is no such free sim card India that you can avail and we warn you to be careful from such fraudulent claims.

## Steps to Obtaining an Indian SIM Card
### Local reference

1. For a prepaid roaming SIM card you will need a local reference name and phone number (For instance you can’t apply for a SIM card in Delhi with a reference in Mumbai- it has to be a local number)
2. It is not necessary that you will have a local reference but you will need one because your local reference will get a call from the network provider within 24 hours of submitting the documents.
3. It is possible that only one phone call is made to the local reference and in case they miss that call, you may have to wait for a day or so get the call again.
4. It is also possible that you may have to repeat the entire documentation process with a different number as your application may be rejected and then you’ll have to wait for another two days.

### Final verification

1. Once the network has called your local reference and your phone becomes active, it should display a signal.

2. You then need to call the activation number (59059) from your phone and confirm the name and address details as provided at the time of applying for your SIM card at the new SIM card price. 

###  Choose a calling plan

1. Traveling around India, outside your circle of Indian SIM card issue, you will generally be considered to pay for ‘cell roaming’.

2. You should still be able to use your phone, but making and receiving calls will be more expensive because of roaming fees which includes mobile roaming charges as well as data roaming charges.

3. Ask the sales executive at your sim card provider in India to help you pick out the plan that suits you the best.

4. As of October 2018, a new method of verification called ‘e-KYC’ was made available to foreign tourists trying to buy a sim card.
What e-KYC Means for Foreigners/Tourists

5. The latest direction issued by the Department of Telecommunication, allows for fulfilment of E-KYC without a government issued Aadhaar (identity) number. This new provision, coupled with the term ‘E-KYC’ has led to some ambiguity.

6. Taken at face value, ‘ eKYC’ suggests an electronic or digital method for submitting pertinent documents via the internet in order to fulfil the KYC requirements needed to buy a local sim card.
To help clarify the new regulation, we’ve outline the new eKYC method below:

7. The Entire process of eKYC verification will be undertaken by Licensees ( shops that sell sim cards) through authorised and official apps.
8. e-KYC is done at Points of Sale or shops.
    Perhaps the most important omission in discussions about the new eKYC process is that a potential customer must be physically present at the Point of Sale ( PoS) or shop, where an Officially Valid Document for identification must be furnished. For example, an original and valid passport or a Driver’s License .
    At the Sim Card store, the merchant or shopkeeper Will take a live photo of the customer, that shall be embedded in a Client Acquisition Form ( C.A.F) by the storeowner. Further, this live photo of the customer shall be watermarked and must be geo tagged. i.e. include GPS coordinates along with time and date. These details are then embedded in the CAF by the shopkeeper, and sent to the regulatory telecom body for verification.
    Once a person’s KYC details are verified, that customer will be given access to an operating sim card.
